# PETL_AST
This is the repository of the paper "Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning of Audio Spectrogram Transformers". 




## Environment setup
The requested libraries for running the experiments are listed in the requirements.txt file. Run the command below to install them.   

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

I use weights and biases (https://wandb.ai/site) for tracking my experiments (I warmly recommend it). Nonetheless, you can deactivate it by setting `--use_wandb = False` in the command line.

I expect that the user has already downloaded the datasets by himself/herself.
